#Program to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle with arbitrary values of length and breadth.
length = int(input("Write the length of the rectangle in cm: "))
breadth = int(input("Write the breadth of the rectangle in cm: "))
area = print("Area =",length*breadth,"cm")
perimeter = print("Perimeter =",2*(length+breadth),"cm")
